# Managing screen state (SPA) with Vanilla JS
Build a page in tabs.html that has:

- A header bar with options Home, About, News, Articles
- A footer with a contact us link

When the items in the header bar are clicked, the "body" of the page should change to the relevant content below. NOTE: You aren't to just change the inner HTML of the body element, as there may be many nested HTML elements within that. You can either solve this via rendering all bodies and toggling which is displayed, or constantly re-rendering whichever one is being displayed currently.
